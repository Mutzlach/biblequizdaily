            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;">After his dramatic conversion on the Damascus road, Saul (who became Paul) transformed from Christianity's greatest persecutor to its most influential missionary. Over approximately 15 years, Paul made three major missionary journeys that took him from Jerusalem to Rome, covering thousands of miles by foot and ship, planting churches across the Roman Empire, and writing letters that would become half of the New Testament. His journeys weren't vacations—they involved beatings, stonings, shipwrecks, imprisonments, and constant danger. Yet through it all, Paul never stopped preaching Christ crucified.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;">This 50-question quiz tests your knowledge of Paul's travels as recorded in Acts chapters 13-28. Easy questions (1-15) cover basic facts about the journeys that anyone who's read Acts should know: Where did Paul start? Who went with him on the first journey? In which city was he stoned? Medium questions (16-35) test detailed knowledge of specific cities, events, and companions. Hard questions (36-50) challenge even serious students of Acts with questions about less-prominent details, specific speeches, and geographical sequences.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px;">Whether you're studying Acts for a Bible class, preparing to teach about Paul's ministry, enriching your understanding of his epistles, or simply want to trace the spread of Christianity across the ancient world, this quiz will deepen your appreciation for how God used one converted Pharisee to turn the world upside down for Christ. Paul's journeys aren't just historical facts—they're blueprints for missionary work, church planting, and faithful ministry in the face of opposition.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 28px; color: #2d3436; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Why Study Paul's Missionary Journeys?</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>It provides crucial context for understanding Paul's letters.</strong> When you read Galatians, knowing that Paul visited those churches on his first journey helps you understand why he's so passionate—these were his first converts being deceived by false teachers. When you read Philippians, knowing Paul wrote it from prison makes "Rejoice in the Lord always" even more powerful. When you read 1 and 2 Corinthians, understanding Paul spent 18 months in Corinth planting that church explains why he addresses their problems so directly. The epistles make more sense when you know the journeys.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>It shows how the gospel spread from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.</strong> Jesus told the disciples in Acts 1:8 that they would be His witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Paul's journeys fulfilled that prophecy. He took the gospel from Jewish synagogues to Gentile cities, from Asia Minor to Europe, from small towns to major Roman centers like Corinth, Ephesus, and Rome itself. Within 30 years of Jesus's resurrection, Christianity had spread across the entire Mediterranean world. Paul's journeys demonstrate that the Great Commission isn't optional—it's the church's mission.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>It reveals Paul's missionary strategy that still works today.</strong> Paul didn't wander randomly. He targeted major cities along Roman trade routes where the gospel could spread. He started in synagogues with Jews who knew Scripture, then reached Gentiles. He planted churches, trained leaders like Timothy and Titus, then moved on while staying connected through letters and return visits. He supported himself by tentmaking when necessary. He adapted his message to different audiences (compare his sermon in a Jewish synagogue to his Mars Hill speech to Greek philosophers). Modern missionaries still follow Paul's strategic, church-planting, indigenous-leadership model.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>It demonstrates that God works through suffering and opposition.</strong> Paul faced opposition in almost every city: mobs in Lystra, riots in Ephesus, false accusations in Jerusalem, beatings, imprisonments, shipwrecks. Yet each obstacle became an opportunity. Prison in Philippi led to the jailer's conversion. Arrest in Jerusalem led to testimony before governors and kings. Shipwreck on Malta led to an entire island hearing the gospel. Paul wrote most of his epistles from prison. His suffering didn't stop God's work—it advanced it. This encourages believers facing opposition today: God isn't surprised by persecution, and He can use it for His glory.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>It shows the importance of faithful companions in ministry.</strong> Paul never traveled alone. Barnabas encouraged him early on. Silas sang with him in prison. Timothy became like a son to him. Luke traveled with him and recorded his journeys. Priscilla and Aquila worked alongside him. Titus handled difficult church problems. Ministry is teamwork, not solo performance. Paul's journeys teach us to find faithful companions, invest in younger believers, and work together to spread the gospel. The "Paul and Barnabas" or "Paul and Silas" model is still the healthiest way to do ministry—iron sharpening iron.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>First Missionary Journey (Acts 13-14):</strong> Paul and Barnabas, sent by the church in Antioch, traveled to Cyprus (Barnabas's home), then to the southern coast of Asia Minor (modern Turkey). They visited Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra (where Paul was stoned), and Derbe, planting churches and appointing elders. This journey established the pattern: preach in synagogues, face opposition, reach Gentiles, plant churches, return to encourage new believers. The journey lasted about 2 years.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Second Missionary Journey (Acts 15:36-18:22):</strong> After a disagreement with Barnabas over John Mark, Paul took Silas and revisited the churches from the first journey. Then, in a vision, Paul was called to Macedonia—taking the gospel to Europe for the first time. They planted churches in Philippi (where Paul and Silas were imprisoned and sang at midnight), Thessalonica (where Jason housed them), Berea (where people searched the Scriptures daily), Athens (where Paul preached on Mars Hill), and spent 18 months in Corinth. Timothy and Luke joined the team. This journey lasted about 3 years.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Third Missionary Journey (Acts 18:23-21:17):</strong> Paul again visited previous churches, then spent almost 3 years in Ephesus—his longest stay in any city. His teaching was so powerful that even handkerchiefs touched by Paul healed the sick. A riot erupted when silversmiths feared Christianity would ruin their idol-making business. Paul then traveled through Macedonia and Greece, wrote Romans while in Corinth, and headed back to Jerusalem despite prophecies warning he would be imprisoned there. This journey lasted about 4 years.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Journey to Rome (Acts 21:18-28:31):</strong> Paul was arrested in Jerusalem, spent 2 years imprisoned in Caesarea, and appealed to Caesar. His journey to Rome included a dramatic shipwreck on Malta where he was bitten by a poisonous snake but unharmed. He reached Rome and spent 2 years under house arrest, preaching to all who visited. Most scholars believe Paul was eventually martyred in Rome under Nero's persecution, likely beheaded since he was a Roman citizen.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 28px; color: #2d3436; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Study Tips for This Quiz</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;">Paul's journeys cover 16 chapters of Acts with dozens of cities, companions, and events. Here's how to prepare:</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Read Acts 13-28 before taking the quiz.</strong> Seriously. Don't rely on vague memories or Sunday School lessons from years ago. Read the actual accounts of Paul's journeys. You'll be amazed at details you forgot or never noticed. The quiz tests specific information from these chapters, so fresh reading significantly improves your score. Plan to spend 2-3 hours reading these 16 chapters—it's worth it.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Make a chart of the three journeys.</strong> List the cities Paul visited on each journey in order. Note key events in each city (conversion, miracle, riot, imprisonment). Identify which companions joined him when. Creating a visual chart helps you see the big picture and remember sequences. Many study Bibles include maps of Paul's journeys—study those maps while reading Acts.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Learn the major cities on each journey.</strong> First journey: Cyprus, Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe. Second journey: Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinth. Third journey: Ephesus (primary focus), Macedonia, Greece. Journey to Rome: Caesarea, Malta, Rome. When you know which cities belong to which journey, many quiz questions become easier because you can eliminate wrong answers based on journey chronology.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Know Paul's main companions.</strong> Barnabas (first journey), Silas (second journey), Timothy (joined second journey), Luke (joined second journey intermittently, evidenced by "we" passages in Acts), Priscilla and Aquila (met in Corinth, worked with Paul), Titus (not mentioned in Acts but prominent in Paul's letters). Understanding who traveled with Paul when helps you answer companion-related questions.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 30px;"><strong>Connect the journeys to Paul's letters.</strong> Galatians = churches from first journey. 1 & 2 Thessalonians = church from second journey. 1 & 2 Corinthians = church from second journey. Ephesians = church from third journey. Philippians, Colossians, Philemon = "prison epistles" from Rome. Romans = written during third journey. Knowing which letters connect to which journeys adds depth to both the journeys and the epistles.</p>
            
            <h2 style="font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; font-size: 28px; color: #2d3436; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 40px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>How many missionary journeys did Paul take?</strong> Paul made three major missionary journeys (Acts 13-21), plus a fourth journey to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27-28). Some scholars count the Rome journey separately since Paul was a prisoner, not a free missionary. But it still resulted in gospel proclamation and church encouragement, so it accomplished missionary purposes even under constraint.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>How long did the journeys take?</strong> Collectively, Paul's journeys spanned about 12-15 years (approximately AD 46-60). First journey: ~2 years. Second journey: ~3 years. Third journey: ~4 years. Time in prison and journey to Rome: ~4 years. These aren't precise dates (scholars debate exact chronology), but this gives you a timeframe. Paul spent roughly half his ministry traveling and half imprisoned.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>How far did Paul travel?</strong> Estimates suggest Paul walked and sailed over 10,000 miles during his journeys—equivalent to crossing the United States 3-4 times. This was before cars, planes, or paved roads. He walked dusty trails, sailed dangerous seas, crossed mountains, and endured extreme weather. His commitment to spreading the gospel was extraordinary by any standard.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Is this quiz too hard for me?</strong> If you've read the book of Acts at least once, you'll recognize most Easy and Medium questions. The Hard questions test specific details that require careful reading or multiple passes through Acts. Don't be discouraged by a modest score—use it as motivation to study Acts more carefully. Most people improve dramatically on their second attempt after studying the passages they missed.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Can I use this quiz for Bible study groups?</strong> Absolutely! This quiz is perfect for groups studying Acts, Paul's life, or early church history. Many groups read Acts 13-28 together over several weeks, then take this quiz as a fun assessment and discussion starter. Questions people miss often lead to great conversations about details they overlooked or connections they didn't make.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>How long does the quiz take?</strong> Most people complete all 50 questions in 20-25 minutes. This quiz requires more thought than basic Bible quizzes since it tests specific geographic, chronological, and biographical details. Take your time, think through each question, and use it as a learning opportunity. There's no timer.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Why does knowing Paul's journeys matter?</strong> Because geography matters for understanding theology. When you know Paul planted the Galatian churches on his first journey, you understand why he's shocked they're "so soon removed" to a false gospel (Galatians 1:6). When you know he spent 3 years in Ephesus, you appreciate why his farewell to the Ephesian elders (Acts 20) is so emotional. When you know he wrote Romans while in Corinth preparing to go to Jerusalem (where he'd be arrested), his request for prayers in Romans 15:30-31 becomes urgent. Geography gives you context for theology.</p>
            
            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #636e72; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>What if I score poorly?</strong> That means you discovered specific gaps in your knowledge of Acts—which is valuable! Review the questions you missed, read those passages in Acts, then retake the quiz. Many people who score 60% on their first attempt score 85%+ on their second attempt a week later after targeted study. The quiz isn't a judgment of your faith—it's a diagnostic tool showing where to focus your Bible study.</p>
